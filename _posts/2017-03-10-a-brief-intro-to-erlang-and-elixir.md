This post is for newbies who want to get started with Elixir, a new programming language which is based on Erlang. 

Elixir is a dynamic and functional programming language built on top of Erlang VM (BEAM). Erlang has been around for long and is the language that powers most of the telephone exchanges around the world. Erlang was developed by Ericsson to power their switches with the capability to handle multiple concurrent connections. The language is compiled to C using BEAM VM. The language, together with the VM and its OTP (Open Telecom Platform) framework made the telephone systems more stable and reliable that can handle concurrent operations with little to no downtime, right out of the box. Lately, Erlang has been adopted in modern day applications outside Telecom.

In spite of being matured and successful over the years, Erlang has always been elusive. Elixir comes in to fill this gap. Elixir as a language is relatively much easier to start and grasp. Elixir users the same VM and offers the same advantages as Erlang while being more productive. Elixir is even interoperable with Erlang. We can use standard library of Erlang as well as third-party packages from inside Elixir. 

If you are interested by now, there are enough resources available online to help you get started. My personal choice is [this](https://elixirschool.com/ "Elixir School"). The official documentation is also excellent. Elixir has a community that is wonderful and friendly. Here are few other resources that might help in your learning.
