Here is a simple one page Contact form example written in PHP

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$demo = "some text";
echo $demo;
?>
{% endhighlight %} 

The above page requires 'class.phpmailer.php' which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/class.phpmailer.php "PHPMailer"). Include it in the same directory as the above file.
