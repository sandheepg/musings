Canonical have launched Ubuntu 12.10 with the slogan â€œAvoid The Pain of Windows 8â€œ. This latest version sports many cool upgrades like Unity Previews, Theme tweaks, and Unity Webapps to name a few. You can download it from the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ "Ubuntu") website as usual. In case you want to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 run your Software Updater. This should prompt you for a upgrade to 12.10. In case you still unable to see it, check the updates tab and select *Any New version* in the last drop down. Re-launch the Software updater and you should now see prompt to upgrade to 12.10.

Make sure you are connected to internet with decent speed. Its always recommended to take a backup of your existing data before proceeding for an update. Click on the upgrade button and grab a coffee. It will take around 30-45 minutes for the upgrade to finish (YMMV). Reboot the system and you are greeted with brand new version of your favourite OS.

Take a quick tour and am sure you will love the features. If you find something is breaking .. no issues the os is backed with a community who posts regular fixes and tweaks which should fix your issues in no time.

I had my share of problems when updated to Ubuntu 12.10 from 12.04. My wireless stopped working. I couldnâ€™t connect to any of the wireless networks. Iâ€™ve ran apt-get update without much luck. With quick googling iâ€™ve found the fix. Follow the below steps to fix the issue with the Broadcom wireless driver.


** Uninstall all wireless drivers. Use Synaptic Package Manager to do it for you.

** If not already installed, you can install Synaptic by running
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install synaptic
{% endhighlight %} 

** In Synaptic, do a search for bcm. All boxes with a green box next to them select for complete removal.

** Then mark __firmware-b43-lpphy-installer__ and accept the recommended for installation.

** Click on Apply.

** Reboot the system once done.

You should have a working wireless now.
